================================================================================

## 🎯 **THE 5-PART PROMPT FORMULA**

Google's official recommended structure for Veo 3.1 prompts:

```
[Cinematography] + [Subject] + [Action] + [Context] + [Style & Ambiance]
```

### **Component Breakdown**

#### 1. **Cinematography**
Define camera work and shot composition:
- **Shot Types**: Wide shot, medium shot, close-up, extreme close-up
- **Camera Angles**: Eye-level, low-angle, high-angle, bird's-eye, Dutch angle
- **Camera Movements**: Static, pan, tilt, dolly, truck, crane, handheld, arc shot
- **Lens Effects**: Shallow depth of field, wide-angle, rack focus, fisheye

#### 2. **Subject**
Identify the main character or focal point with specificity:
- Physical attributes, clothing, distinctive features
- Profession, role, or character type
- Emotional state and demeanor

#### 3. **Action**
Describe what the subject is doing:
- Primary movement or behavior
- Interactions with environment or other subjects
- Emotional expressions and subtle gestures

#### 4. **Context**
Detail the environment and background:
- Location (interior/exterior)
- Time of day and weather
- Atmospheric details and props

#### 5. **Style & Ambiance**
Specify overall aesthetic, mood, and lighting:
- Lighting setup and quality
- Color palette and visual tone
- Film style or genre aesthetic

### **Example Prompt Using 5-Part Formula**

```
Medium shot, a tired corporate worker, rubbing his temples in exhaustion, in front of a bulky 1980s computer in a cluttered office late at night. The scene is lit by the harsh fluorescent overhead lights and the green glow of the monochrome monitor. Retro aesthetic, shot as if on 1980s color film, slightly grainy.
```

================================================================================

## 🎭 **CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK**

### **Character Consistency Template**

For maintaining character consistency across multiple shots:

```
[NAME/ROLE], a [AGE] [ETHNICITY] [GENDER] with [HAIR_DETAILS], [EYE_COLOR] eyes, [FACIAL_FEATURES], [BUILD], wearing [CLOTHING], with [POSTURE/MANNERISMS], [EMOTIONAL_STATE]
```

### **Physical Attribute Checklist**

✅ **Essential Elements:**
- Age and appearance
- Gender presentation
- Hair: color, style, length, texture
- Eyes: color, shape, expression
- Facial features: distinctive characteristics
- Build: height, weight, body type
- Clothing: style, color, fit, material
- Posture and movement patterns
- Emotional baseline

### **Character Consistency Rules**

1. **Identical Descriptions**: Use exact same wording across all prompts in a series
2. **Reference Images**: Use 1-3 consistent reference images per character
3. **Wardrobe Lock**: Keep clothing and accessories consistent
4. **Pose Similarity**: Maintain similar poses in reference images to reduce drift
5. **Aspect Ratio Lock**: Don't switch between 16:9 and 9:16 mid-project

================================================================================

## 🎬 **CINEMATOGRAPHY INTEGRATION**

### **Camera Angles Reference**

| Angle | Effect | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Eye-level | Neutral, relatable | "eye-level shot of a woman sipping tea" |
| Low-angle | Powerful, imposing | "low-angle tracking shot of a superhero landing" |
| High-angle | Vulnerable, small | "high-angle shot of a child lost in a crowd" |
| Bird's-eye | Map-like overview | "bird's-eye view of a bustling city intersection" |
| Dutch angle | Unease, dynamism | "dutch angle shot of a character running down a hallway" |

### **Camera Movements Reference**

| Movement | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Static | No movement | "static shot of a serene landscape" |
| Pan | Horizontal rotation | "slow pan left across a city skyline at dusk" |
| Tilt | Vertical rotation | "tilt down from face to letter in hands" |
| Dolly | Physical in/out | "dolly out to emphasize isolation" |
| Truck | Horizontal travel | "truck right, following character walking" |
| Crane | Vertical sweep | "crane shot revealing vast battlefield" |
| Handheld | Realistic, immediate | "handheld camera during chaotic chase" |
| Arc | Circular path | "arc shot around couple embracing" |

### **Shot Composition Framework**

| Shot Type | Framing | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Extreme Wide (EWS) | Full environment | Establishing location |
| Wide Shot (WS) | Full body + environment | Context and scale |
| Medium Shot (MS) | Waist up | Dialogue, conversation |
| Close-Up (CU) | Head and shoulders | Emotion, connection |
| Extreme Close-Up (ECU) | Eyes/detail only | Intense emotion, detail |

### **Lens & Optical Effects**

- **Shallow depth of field**: Subject sharp, background bokeh
- **Rack focus**: Shift focus between foreground and background
- **Wide-angle**: Expanded field of view, slight distortion
- **Fisheye**: Extreme barrel distortion, panoramic
- **Vertigo effect (dolly zoom)**: Background perspective shift while subject stays same size

================================================================================

## 🔊 **AUDIO ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE**

### **Native Audio Generation**

Veo 3.1 generates synchronized audio with video. Clearly specify audio elements in your prompt using separate sentences.

### **Audio Element Types**

#### **Dialogue**
Use quotation marks with character identification:

```
✅ RECOMMENDED FORMAT:
"The seasoned detective says: 'Your story has holes.'"
"A woman says, 'We have to leave now.'"
"The narrator speaks with a polished British accent in a serious, urgent tone."
```

#### **Sound Effects (SFX)**
Describe individual, distinct sounds:

```
"SFX: thunder cracks in the distance"
"The sound of a phone ringing"
"Soft house sounds, the creak of a closet door, and a ticking clock"
```

#### **Ambient Noise**
Define background soundscape:

```
"Ambient noise: the quiet hum of a starship bridge"
"The sounds of city traffic and distant sirens"
"Waves crashing on the shore"
```

### **Audio Best Practices**

1. **Keep**: Use native audio when ambient/environmental sound fits the scene
2. **Refine**: Check for audio jumps between clips; crossfade in NLE
3. **Replace**: For brand work, precise dialogue, or music-driven pieces, plan to replace native audio

### **Lip-Sync Note**
Exact lip-sync is not guaranteed. For projects requiring precise lip movement, plan for VO alignment and possible retiming in your NLE.

================================================================================

```

================================================================================

## 🔧 **QUALITY ASSURANCE PROTOCOLS**

### **Pre-Generation Checklist**

- ✅ Subject description is specific and detailed
- ✅ Action is singular and clear (one major action per shot)
- ✅ Camera work specifies shot type, angle, and movement
- ✅ Context includes location, time, and atmospheric details
- ✅ Style & ambiance defines lighting and visual aesthetic
- ✅ Audio elements are explicitly specified if needed
- ✅ Negative prompts describe unwanted elements (not using "no" or "don't")
- ✅ Duration is appropriate for action complexity
- ✅ Reference images prepared if character consistency needed
- ✅ Aspect ratio matches delivery platform

### **Effective Negative Prompts**

**Format**: Describe what you don't want to see (avoid instructive language)

```
❌ AVOID: "no walls" or "don't show walls"
✅ USE: "wall, frame" (meaning you don't want these elements)
```

**Common Quality Control Negatives:**
```
subtitles, captions, watermark, text overlays, words on screen, logo, blurry footage, low resolution, artifacts, distorted hands, compression noise, camera shake
```

### **QC Checklist After Generation**

- **Subject**: Is the character/object exactly what you asked for?
- **Motion**: Is the action readable and not jittery?
- **Framing**: Does the camera match your plan?
- **Lighting**: Does the mood match your specification?
- **Audio**: Does the native audio generally fit?

================================================================================

## ⏱️ **TIMESTAMP PROMPTING**

### **Multi-Shot Sequencing**

Create complete sequences with precise cinematic pacing in a single generation by assigning actions to timed segments:

```
[00:00-00:02] Medium shot from behind a young female explorer with a leather satchel and messy brown hair in a ponytail, as she pushes aside a large jungle vine to reveal a hidden path.

[00:02-00:04] Reverse shot of the explorer's freckled face, her expression filled with awe as she gazes upon ancient, moss-covered ruins in the background. SFX: The rustle of dense leaves, distant exotic bird calls.

[00:04-00:06] Tracking shot following the explorer as she steps into the clearing and runs her hand over the intricate carvings on a crumbling stone wall. Emotion: Wonder and reverence.

[00:06-00:08] Wide, high-angle crane shot, revealing the lone explorer standing small in the center of the vast, forgotten temple complex, half-swallowed by the jungle. SFX: A swelling, gentle orchestral score begins to play.
```

### **Timestamp Best Practices**

- Use 2-second segments for distinct beats
- Maintain character consistency across segments
- Specify camera changes at each timestamp
- Include audio cues where appropriate
- Keep total duration within 8 seconds

================================================================================

## 🖼️ **REFERENCE IMAGES & INGREDIENTS TO VIDEO**

### **Reference Image System**

Use up to 3 reference images per generation to maintain consistency:

- **Character Reference**: Lock appearance across shots
- **Object Reference**: Maintain product/prop consistency
- **Style Reference**: Ensure aesthetic continuity

### **Ingredients to Video Workflow**

1. **Generate References**: Create reference images using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image or similar
2. **Compose Scene**: Use Ingredients to Video feature with relevant references
3. **Prompt with References**: Specify which reference applies to which element

**Example:**
```
"Using the provided images for the detective, the woman, and the office setting, create a medium shot of the detective behind his desk. He looks up at the woman and says in a weary voice, 'Of all the offices in this town, you had to walk into mine.'"
```

### **Consistency Tips**

- Keep subject's clothing and pose similar in references
- Reuse the same 1-3 references across related clips
- Lock aspect ratio across your project
- Use shorter durations (4-6s) for action-heavy beats

================================================================================

## 🔗 **FIRST AND LAST FRAME CONTROL**

### **Dynamic Transitions**

Create controlled camera movements or transformations between two distinct points:

**Step 1**: Create starting frame (image generation)
```
"Medium shot of a female pop star singing passionately into a vintage microphone. She is on a dark stage, lit by a single, dramatic spotlight from the front. Photorealistic, cinematic."
```

**Step 2**: Create ending frame
```
"POV shot from behind the singer on stage, looking out at a large, cheering crowd. The stage lights are bright, creating lens flare. Energetic atmosphere."
```

**Step 3**: Animate with Veo 3.1
```
"The camera performs a smooth 180-degree arc shot, starting with the front-facing view of the singer and circling around her to seamlessly end on the POV shot from behind her on stage. The singer sings 'when you look me in the eyes, I can see a million stars.'"
```

### **Use Cases**

- Controlled camera movements between specific compositions
- Smooth transitions between scenes
- Maintaining lighting and composition cohesion

================================================================================

## 🔄 **CLIP EXTENSION WORKFLOWS**

### **Building Longer Sequences**

Extend previously generated Veo clips to build longer sequences:

1. **Generate Base Clip**: Create your best short clip (4-8s)
2. **Review and Select**: Choose the strongest generation
3. **Extend**: Use extension feature to continue the action
4. **Iterate**: Refine extensions as needed

### **Extension Best Practices**

- Start with shorter durations (4-6s) for complex action
- Extend only your best clips
- Maintain consistent prompt language
- Use first/last frame control for smooth handoffs
- Plan to stitch multiple clips in your NLE for final edit

================================================================================

## ⚠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING & OPTIMIZATION**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Soft/smeared motion | Too many concurrent actions | Shorten to 4-6s; simplify action; add reference image |
| Character identity drift | Inconsistent references | Reuse same 1-3 references; keep wardrobe similar |
| Lighting shifts between clips | Prompt language variance | Standardize 2-3 lighting descriptors; use frame control |
| Camera mismatch | Vague terms ("cinematic" only) | Specify focal length, shot size, direction |
| Distracting native audio | Ambience/level mismatch | Disable and replace in NLE |
| Repeated artifacts | Seed stuck; over-constrained | Change seed; reduce adjectives; adjust one variable |

### **Practical Prompting Rules**

1. **One major action per shot** - Complex multi-action scenes fragment
2. **Use reference images when consistency matters** - Up to 3 per generation
3. **Lock aspect ratio for the project** - Don't flip mid-project
4. **Keep language plain** - Replace poetic metaphors with visual specifics
5. **Use seed for reproducibility** - Change seed when stuck in a "look rut"
6. **Move one variable at a time** - Adjust camera OR lighting, not both

================================================================================

## 🎯 **DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SPECIALIZATION**

### **Corporate Communications**

```
Corporate Standards:
- Executive presence and authority
