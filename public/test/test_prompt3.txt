Create a 20-second animated cat travel agency commercial in high-quality CGI style with vibrant colors, realistic textures, dynamic lighting, and fluid animal animations. The main character is a fluffy Ragdoll cat named Belle, with cream and brown fur, pointed ears, blue eyes, and a curious expression. Set on the mirror-like salt flats of Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, at sunset, with endless reflections, a fiery horizon, and scattered salt crystals for a magical, otherworldly feel.

Timeline breakdown:

- 0-5 seconds: Wide shot of Belle arriving on the flats, looking awe-struck but weary from travel, pawing at her reflection in the shallow water. Golden sunlight bathes the scene; soft wind effects ripple the surface.

- 5-10 seconds: Tracking shot as Belle spots a picnic setup with cat treats and a travel map, her ears perking up. Use glowing highlights on the reflective flats to emphasize vast beauty.

- 10-18 seconds: Montage of Belle exploring energetically—chasing reflections, posing by salt mounds, and gazing at the sunset. Add playful particle effects for salt sparkles and paw prints.

- 18-20 seconds: Fade to text overlay in whimsical font: 'Belle's Bolivia Adventure with [Agency] – Purrfect Getaways!' with a cat paw icon.

Audio: Upbeat adventure tune with pan flutes and light percussion; include meows, crunching sounds, and wind whispers. Ensure 4K resolution, seamless transitions, and emotional shift from arrival to delight for engaging pet travel promotion.
