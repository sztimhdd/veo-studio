Create a 20-second animated dog food commercial in high-quality CGI style with vibrant colors, realistic textures, dynamic lighting, and fluid motion capture for lifelike animal movements. The main character is a loyal Shiba Inu dog named Kiko, with fluffy red fur, alert ears, and expressive eyes. Set in the ancient city of Kyoto, Japan, featuring cherry blossoms, traditional temples, stone lanterns, and bustling streets with pagodas in the background for an adventurous, cultural vibe.
Timeline breakdown:

0-5 seconds: Wide establishing shot of Kiko arriving in Kyoto, looking excited but tired from travel, sniffing around a temple garden with an empty backpack. Soft morning light filters through sakura trees; Kiko whimpers softly.
5-10 seconds: Close-up as a can of premium dog food opens nearby, revealing steam-rising chunks of fresh meat, rice, and veggies inspired by Japanese cuisine. Kiko's tail wags vigorously; use glowing highlights to emphasize the food's appeal.
10-18 seconds: Montage of Kiko eating energetically, then exploring Kyoto revitalized—running through bamboo groves, posing at a shrine, and playing in a zen garden. Add playful particle effects for petals and food aromas.
18-20 seconds: Fade to text overlay in elegant, modern font: 'Kiko's Adventure Fueled by [Brand] Dog Food – Perfect for Travel!' with a paw print icon.

Audio: Upbeat Japanese-inspired soundtrack with shamisen and light drums; include realistic sounds like can 'pop', crunching bites, and Kiko's happy barks. Ensure 4K resolution, seamless pacing, and emotional arc from fatigue to joy to inspire pet owners for global trips.
